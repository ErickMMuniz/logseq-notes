    abstract  = "This text is a concise modern introduction to the science of
                 complex networks, and is based on lectures for university
                 students and non-specialists. The author aims to introduce a
                 reader without serious background in mathematics or physics to
                 the world of networks. The lectures fill the existing gap
                 between popular science books and comprehensive reference
                 volumes on complex networks, and provide the shortest path to
                 the world of networks, discussing the main directions of modern
                 research in this active field, as well as the history of network
                 studies. The text describes the current state of the art in
                 complex networks and includes recent results, and will be useful
                 for both teaching and self-study.",
